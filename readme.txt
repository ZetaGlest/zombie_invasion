Attention

This is not an official pack, -MegaGlest cannot play correctly the zombie_invasion faction- maybe you can see zombies in the zombie_invasion faction cost 0 gold, you must survive to special scenarios "look the screenshots".
You can also create your own scenarios and play the zombies.
This pack is based on mc_pack and on imperial_m_g packs, you cannot produce zombies with minecraft and cannot produce flying unities with techs.
The zombie_invasion loading_screen have been created with Gimp by me, it's posted on the MegaGlest FR community on Google+ and it's a creative commons picture, you can use it for a background or in a video or another thing, it's a present :D
